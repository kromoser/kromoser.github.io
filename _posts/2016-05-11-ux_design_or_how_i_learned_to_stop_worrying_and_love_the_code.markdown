I am a graphic designer, and for a while now, a big portion of my work has been web design. I make websites that are pretty static, but elegantly simple. I taught myself HTML and CSS after graduating with a studio art degree and felt I needed a portfolio site to show [the weird hand-drawn animations](http://vimeo.com/kromoser) I had made. Thus began years of lurking on StackOverflow, and reading tons of [CSS tricks](http://css-tricks.com). And I've certainly loved learning it all, as challenging as it can be.

One idea has always troubled me, though. The idea of UX design. Isn't all design user experience design? When a book designer chooses a paper stock for a cover, that's UX design. When a furniture designer chooses a fabric that you'll be sitting on, that's user experience design. And so is everything else that went into that chair, from the initial sketches to the last piece of hardware put in place. I don't think user experience design is a discipline to be laid on top of other design practices. Rather, it emerges from the building of a thing. In the thoughtful act of its creation comes the experience of using it.

And this is why I'm learning to code in earnest with the Flatiron School's Learn Verified Program. I love my work as a designer. I love giving websites their look and feel. But what I'm most excited by is building the parts of things that are great because you don't see them. And you don't see them because they're built well, designed well, coded well. The worst thing for me as a designer is the feeling that I'm making a bad foundation look good. Through code, I want to build the foundations from which awesome online experiences emerge. I want to make things because making *is* designing. There's nothing more creative than turning lines of code into an honest-to-goodness real-life human experience.

Currently, I'm working on the final labs of the Object Oriented Ruby section of the program, and even though there's an incredible amount more to learn, I already feel like I've grown so much. And not just in the sense that I'm learning new languages, new technologies. I'm thinking about my design projects differently. I'm asking myself, "What's the most efficient, most abstract way to align all of these objects on the page?" When something goes wrong at work, my mind longs for a test spec to read. It's making me think about things from the bottom up. I'm learning to be as concerned with a project's internal structure as I am with its finished appearance. You never see the nails that hold together your favorite, most comfortable, perfectly designed chair, but it's those nails that made it a chair in the first place, that make sitting in it possible. A user won't see all of the decisions that go into how a chair, or a website, is built, but those decisions are there, and those decisions make a great user experience possible.

I'll be periodically updating this blog with my progress through the Learn Verified program and my thoughts about code, design, and their interaction. Thanks for reading, and may all your user experiences be great!
